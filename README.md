## How I set it up
Every line of configuration code I wrote I put in the txt file I uploaded to github and every website I used to help me with code I link in the text file

## Project Diary

# 4.5.2017 - Started
Did steps 1-5 and started on installing Samba. Whenever I ran into problems with the code I googled for a solution

# 5.5.2017
Finished steps 6-7. Ran into problems with apache2 and didn't find solution to it

# 6.6.2017 
Solved my apache problem. Went on to work on the assignment for the rest of the day and finished it.
Ran into problems with SquirrelMail becuase of my misunderstanding and eventually solved it.
Installed ISPConfig-3 through a guide that I link in the text file.

Took pictures of some of the code, not sure what I am suppoed to turn in. Will turn in more after talking to teacher at school 8.5.2017 if I need to
